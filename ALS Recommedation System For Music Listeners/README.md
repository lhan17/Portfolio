# ALS Music Recommendation System
In this project we will make music recommendations according to music listener's preferences. The model training is done with alternative least squares (ALS) and a sample data is taken from "uniqe_tracks.txt" from http://millionsongdataset.com/sites/default/files/AdditionalFiles/unique_tracks.txt.
